Vintageous 2.9.1
==============================================================================

(First time I use Package Control's notifications; fingers crossed!)

Anyway, just a quick note to:

1) Say sorry! If you were affected by the version 2.9 keyboard bug â€” sorry! I
hope you'll be able to use non-Vim key bindings again with 2.9.1. If that
isn't the case, please report your problem in the Github issue tracker.

(By the way, if you used the workaround suggested in Github's issue tracker,
make sure to remove the copied Default.sublime-keymap file from your
Packages/User folder. If this is all Greek to you, you should be fine.)

2) Update you on Vintageous' status: Version 2.9 introduced new internals that
supersede version 2.8's core and should pave the way to major features in the
future. 'There will be bugs', but the experience with 2.9.1 should be on par
with 2.8, save for some features, most notably insert mode keys and visual
block mode. These we'll be added back gradually.

3) Ask you for feedback:

    - Are you a Mac user? I can't test on Macs, so any issues you report are
      especially useful.

    - Do you use a non-Latin language with Vintageous? 2.9+ may then cause
      problems to you in that case. Please report any issues in the Github
      issue tracker.
